# Backstory
- Our teacher had his own website to administer gamified quizzes
- I was curious and looked into how the network requests were getting the questions and if it came with the answers because the game immediately found out if the answers were correct or wrong
- I found that it did contain both question and answers, and with the help of ChatGPT, made a function to parse the response, and display it nicely for me
